# Stochastic-Interest-Rate

Valuing Interest Rate Derivatives under Stochastic Interest Rate Model

•	Used Monte Carlo simulation (Euler-scheme) and derived analytical formula to estimate the term structure of interest rates under a two-factor Vasicek Model

•	Compared the valuation of a bond option using analytical solution, Monte Carlo simulation under the risk-neutral measure and the forward measure

•	Estimated the Black implied volatility of the swaption with strike being today’s swap-rate using simulation method
