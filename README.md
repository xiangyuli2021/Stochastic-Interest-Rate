# Stochastic-Interest-Rate

Valuing Interest Rate Derivatives under Stochastic Interest Rate Model

•	Derived analytical formula to estimate the term structure of interest rates under a two-factor Vasicek Model and compared the result with the Euler-scheme Monte Carlo simulation method implemented via Python

•	Estimated the price of a bond option for a collection of strike price using Monte Carlo simulations and analytical expression under both the risk-neutral and forward-neutral measures

•	Estimated the Black implied volatility of the swaption with strike being today’s swap-rate using simulation method
